## Introduction
The code found at [this repo](https://github.com/JaxJafinPapau/q_self_edamam_microsvc) acts as a microservice, leveraging the [Edamam](https://www.edamam.com/) API to find recepies for the foods stored in the main application. It may be found in production [here](https://frozen-ocean-70450.herokuapp.com/).  

A description of the endpoints for this service may be found on the [README for the main app](https://github.com/JaxJafinPapau/quantified_self/blob/master/README.md#microservice-endpoints)  

A full description of the project may also be found on the [README for the main app](https://github.com/JaxJafinPapau/quantified_self/blob/master/README.md).
